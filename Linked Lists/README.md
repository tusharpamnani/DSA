# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

## Overview

This direcotry contains implementations and explanations of both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Singly Linked List

### Functionality

- **Insertion:**
  - At the beginning
  - At the end
  - At a specific position

- **Deletion:**
  - From the beginning
  - From the end
  - From a specific position

- **Operations:**
  - Searching for an element
  - Traversing the linked list
  - Detecting loops in the linked list
 
## Advantages of Linked Lists

- Dynamic Size
- Efficient Insertion and Deletion:
- No Fixed Size:
- Ease of Implementation:
- No Wasted Memory:

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

- Random Access is Difficult
- Increased Memory Overhead
- Traversal Overhead
- Cache Locality
- Extra Memory for Pointers
- Difficulty in Reversal
- More Complex Implementation for Doubly Linked Lists

### Usage

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Insertion and Deletion
- Implementing Stacks and Queues
- Undo Mechanisms
- Representing Polynomials
- Dynamic Memory Management
- File Systems
- Navigation Systems
- Hash Tables
- Graph Representations
