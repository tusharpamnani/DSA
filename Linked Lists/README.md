# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

## Overview

This direcotry contains implementations and explanations of both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Types of Linked Lists

- Singly Linked List:

  - Each node in a singly linked list contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows traversal only in the forward direction.

- Doubly Linked List:

  - Each node in a doubly linked list contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. This bidirectional linking enables traversal in both forward and backward directions.

- Circular Linked List:

  - In a circular linked list, the last node's next pointer points back to the first node, creating a closed loop. This type allows continuous traversal in a circular manner.

- Doubly Circular Linked List:

  - Similar to a circular linked list, but each node in a doubly circular linked list has a pointer to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional circular traversal.
 
## Advantages of Linked Lists

- Dynamic Size

- No Wasted Memory:

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

- Random Access is Difficult
